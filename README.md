### Initially this appllication started as just the mobile game element, but as time went on and I learnt more about mobile game development, I started to think about whether it would be possible to make a mobile game one element of an application. As I am in a career as an Android developer, it made sense to see whether it would be possible to integrate a Unity Mobile game into a wider Android applciation. The answer was yes.
